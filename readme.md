## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on **predicting student academic performance** using a **machine learning pipeline**.  
The system analyzes historical student data and predicts performance outcomes based on multiple academic and behavioral factors.

The project is designed with a **modular Python architecture**, making it easy to maintain, extend, and deploy.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often struggle to identify students who may underperform academically.

👉 **Goal:**  
Build a machine learning model that predicts student performance early so that timely academic support can be provided.
